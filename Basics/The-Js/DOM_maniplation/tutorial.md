I've created a comprehensive example that demonstrates the main aspects of DOM manipulation. The code includes interactive examples of:

1.  Element Creation and Insertion
    *   Creating new elements using `createElement()`
    *   Inserting elements into specific positions in the DOM
    *   Appending child elements
2.  Element Selection
    *   Selecting by ID using `getElementById()`
    *   Selecting by class using `getElementsByClassName()`
    *   Using query selectors with `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()`
3.  Modifying Elements
    *   Changing text content and innerHTML
    *   Modifying attributes
    *   Manipulating CSS classes
    *   Direct style modifications
4.  Event Handling
    *   Adding event listeners
    *   Handling different types of events (click, input)
    *   Event delegation
    *   Removing event listeners
5.  DOM Traversal
    *   Accessing parent nodes
    *   Working with child nodes
    *   Navigating between siblings
    *   Checking node relationships

Each section includes interactive buttons and demonstrations that you can try out to see the DOM manipulation in action. The code is fully commented and structured for clarity.

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?
