# CSS Units
## absolute units (fixed size)
* px :1px = 1 device pixel
* 1cm = 40px and 1inch = 100px (approx)
## relative units (responsive)
* % : adjust child width and height relative to the parent width and height respectively (work only if parent width and height explicitly declared)
* em :relative to the font size of parent
* rem :relative to the root font size
* vw : viewport width (1vw = 1% of the viewport’s width)
* vh :viewport height (1vh = 1% of the viewport's height)
* fr :fraction commonly used in grid layout (1fr 2fr 1fr)
